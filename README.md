# HTML MISC

A pile of fun, self-contained things made with good ole simple html/css/js.

--------

## __states_and_commands.html__

Trying out using something resembling the command and state design patterns.

Move a box around a grid using the arrow keys or WADS. Each position in the grid has an associated state, and each state has a set of valid moves as commands.


## __drawer_fader.html__

[to be filled out]


## __spinner_tester.html__

Viewer for animated spinners. Included list of spinners is from
https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners/blob/main/spinners.json .


## __(snippets, etc)__

Miscellaneous snippets for testing and noting and a page to make use of them.


--------

As an aside, some code pieces may come off a bit weird and/or old fashioned since I developed a habit of tending to try to write these things in a backward-compatible way due to being stuck using or showing on non-cutting-edge browsers much of the time through the years. I would recommend using modern conveniences on modern projects.
